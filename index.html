          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>I'm Jacob Deguara, a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Malta, class of 2024. During my time at university, I focused heavily on coding projects, particularly in <strong>Computer Graphics</strong>, <strong>Game Development</strong>, <strong>Storage Management</strong>, and <strong>Concurrent Programming Optimisations</strong>. I’ve also delved into theoretical areas such as <strong>Programming Language Principles</strong>, <strong>Computability</strong>, <strong>Complexity Theory</strong>, and <strong>Cryptography</strong>.</p>
          
          <p>With a broad range of interests, I am still exploring my career path, which is the reason behind this portfolio. I enjoy experimenting with new projects, recreating ideas, and exploring fresh concepts. This site showcases my work, findings, and results as I continue to learn and grow.</p>
          
          <p>This portfolio itself is a project where I am experimenting with <strong>Web Development</strong>—an area I’m exploring more deeply since <strong>Web Development</strong>, <strong>AI</strong>, and <strong>Gaming</strong> are particularly prominent in Malta.</p>
          
          <p>I am a highly curious, organised, and detail-oriented individual, always seeking to deepen my understanding of complex systems. I enjoy experimenting with new tools and ideas, which keeps me motivated to tackle diverse projects. However, in sensitive or high-risk environments, I take a more cautious approach to avoid compromising key elements. I bring a positive, can-do attitude to every project, no matter how challenging.</p>
          
          <p>I will later on provide a small showcase of my current completed projects as well as a link to a small blog detailing the expected projects to come. Then go over my experiences and skills aquired with a full breakdown later and my contacts</p>
